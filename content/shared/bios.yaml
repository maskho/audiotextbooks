  name: Abel
  full: Niels Henrik Abel
  bio: |
    __Niels Henrik Abel__ (1802 – 1829) was an important Norwegian
    mathematician. Even though he died at the age of 26, he made groundbreaking
    contributions to a wide range of topics.

    At the age of 16, Abel proved the binomial theorem. Three years later, he
    proved that it is impossible to solve quintic equations – by independently
    inventing group theory. This had been an open problem for over 350 years! He
    also worked on elliptic functions and discovered _Abelian_ functions.

    Abel spent his life in poverty: he had six siblings, his father died when he
    was 18, he was unable to find a job at a university, and many mathematicians
    initially dismissed his work. Today, one of the highest awards in
    mathematics, the _Abel Prize_ is named after him.

  bio: |
    __Maria Gaetana Agnesi__ (1718 – 1799) was an Italian mathematician,
    philosopher, theologian, and humanitarian.  Agnesi was the first western
    woman to write a mathematics textbook. She was also the first woman to be
    appointed professor at a university.

    Her textbook, the _Analytical Institutions for the use of Italian youth_
    combined differential and integral calculus, and was an international
    success.

    Agnesi also studied a bell-shaped curve described by the equation
    `y=a^3/(x^2+a^2)`. This function is now called the _Witch of Agnesi_. The
    strange name might come from a pun in the Italian language, were the word
    “versiera” for “witch” sounds similar to the ropes used when sailing.

    lived in Cairo during the Islamic Golden Age, and studied mathematics,
    physics, astronomy, philosophy, and medicine. He was a proponent of the
    _scientific method_: the belief that any scientific hypothesis must be
    verified using experiments or mathematical logic – centuries before
    European scientists during the Renaissance.

    Al-Haytham was particularly interested in optics and visual perception. He
    also derived a formula for the sum of fourth powers (`1^4 + 2^4 + 3^4 + … +
    n^4`), and he studied the link between algebra and geometry.

    Baghdad. He worked at the “House of Wisdom”, which contained the first large
    collection of academic books since the destruction of the Library of
    Alexandria.

    Al-Khwarizmi has been called the “Father of algebra” – in fact, the word
    _algebra_ comes from the Arabic title of his most important book: “The
    Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing”. In it, he
    showed how to solve linear and quadratic equations, and for many centuries,
    it was the main mathematics textbook at European universities.

    __Archimedes__ (c. 287 – 212 BCE) was an ancient Greek scientist and
    engineer, and one of the greatest mathematicians of all time. He discovered
    many concepts of calculus and worked in geometry, analysis and mechanics.

    While taking a bath, Archimedes discovered a way to determine the volume of
    irregular objects using the amount of water they displaced when submerged.
    He was so excited by this discovery that he ran out on the street, still
    undressed, yelling _“Eureka!”_ (Greek for _“I have found it!”_).

    As an engineer, he built ingenious defence machines during the siege of his
    home city Syracuse in Sicily. After two years, the Romans finally managed to
    enter, and Archimedes was killed. His last words were _“Do not disturb my
    circles”_ – which he was studying at the time.

    and engineer. He is often called the “father of the computer”, having
    invented the first mechanical computer (the _Difference engine_), and an
    improved, programmable version (the _Analytical Engine_).

    In theory, these machines could automatically perform certain calculations
    stored on cards or tape. However, due to the high production costs, they
    were never fully completed during Babbage’s lifetime. In 1991, a functional
    replica was constructed at the Science Museum in London.

    academic rivalry with several of his brothers and sons.

    Bernoulli made significant advances to the calculus that was invented by
    Newton and Leibnitz, created the field of _calculus of variations_,
    discovered the fundamental constant _e_, developed techniques for solving
    differential equations, and much more.

    He published the first substantial work about probability, including

    including his father Johann, his uncle Jacob, and his brother Nicholas.

    Daniel Bernoulli showed that as the speed of a fluid increases, its pressure
    decreases. Now called _Bernoulli’s principle_, this is the mechanism used by
    airplane wings and combustion engines. He also made important discoveries
    in probability and statistics, and first encountered _Bessel functions_.

  bio: |
    The German mathematician __Georg Cantor__ (1845 – 1918) was the inventor of
    set theory, and a pioneer in our understanding of infinity. For most of his
    life, Cantor's discoveries were fiercely opposed by his colleagues. This may
    have contributed to his depression and nervous breakdowns, and he spent many
    decades in a mental institution.

    Cantor proved that there are _different sizes_ of infinity. The set of real
    numbers, for example, is _uncountable_ – meaning that it cannot be paired up
    with the set of natural numbers.

    Only towards the end of his life, Cantor started to receive the recognition
    he deserved. David Hilbert famously declared that “No one shall expel us
    from the paradise that Cantor has created”.

    moves around it on a circle. He also predicted that Earth rotates around its
    axis once every day. Afraid that it would upset the Catholic church, he
    only published the model just before his death – triggering what is now

    logician. He studied the geometric properies of complex numbers, formalised
    mathematical induction, suggested quaternions, and came up with new
    mathematical notation.

    The _De Morgan laws_ explain how to transform logical relationships in
    set theory, for example `bar(A ∩ B) = bar(A) ∪ bar(B)` and
    `bar(A ∪ B) = bar(A) ∩ bar(B)`.

    In mathematics, Desargues is considered the father of _projective geometry_.
    This is a special kind of geometry in which parallel lines meet at at “point
    at infinity”, the size of shapes does not matter (only their proportions),
    and all four conic sections (circle, ellipse, parabola and hyperbola) are
    essentially the same.

    accept the authority of previous philosophers, and one of his best-known
    quotes is “I think, therefore I am”.

    Descartes is the father of _analytical geometry_, which allows us to
    describe geometric shapes using algebra. This was one of the prerequisites,
    which allowed Newton and Leibnitz to invent _calculus_ a few decades later.

    The French mathematician __Évariste Galois__ (1811 – 1832) had a short and
    tragic life, yet he invented two entirely new fields of mathematics: _Group
    theory_ and _Galois theory_.

    While still in his teens, Galois proved that there is no general solution
    for polynomial equations of degree five or higher – simultaneously with
    Niels Abel.

    Unfortunately, other mathematicians who he shared these discoveries with
    repeatedly misplaced or simply returned his work, and he failed his school
    and university exams while concentrating on much more complex work.

    At the age of 20, Galois was shot in a duel (some say a feud over a woman),
    and later died of his wounds. During the night before his death, he
    summarised his mathematical discoveries in a letter to a friend. It would
    take other mathematicians many years to fully understand these letters, and
    realise the impact of his work.

    The French mathematician __Henri Poincaré__ (1854 – 1912) is often
    described as _the last universalist_, meaning that he worked in every field
    of mathematics known during his lifetime.

    Poincaré is one of the founders of the field of _Topology_, and he came up
    with the _Poincaré conjecture_. This was one of the famous unsolved problems
    in mathematics, until it was proven in 2003 by Grigori Perelman

    He also found a partial solution for the “three body problem”, and
    discovered that the motion of three stars or planets in space can be
    completely unpredictable. This laid the foundation for modern _Chaos
    theory_.

    Poincaré was the first to propose _gravitational waves_, and his work on
    Lorentz transformations was the basis upon which Albert Einstein built his
    theory of special relativity.

    centre and all planets and the sun revolve around this.

    While we know today this model is incorrect, Ptolemy’s scientific impact is
    indisputable. He developed trigonometric tables with many practical
    applications, which remained the most accurate for many centuries. He also

    Pythagoras tried to explain music in a mathematical way, and discovered that
    two tones sound “nice” together (consonant) if the ratio of their
    frequencies is a simple fraction.

    He also founded a school in Italy where he and his students worshipped
    mathematics almost like a religion, while following a number of bizarre

    ideas in complete isolation, while working as a clerk in a small shop.

    After a few failed attempts to contact other mathematicians, he wrote a
    letter to the famous G.H. Hardy. Hardy immediately recognised Ramanujan's
    genius, and arranged for him to travel to Cambridge in England. Together,
    they made numerous discoveries in number theory, analysis, and infinite
    series.

    Unfortunately, Ramanujan soon fell ill and was forced to return to India,
    where he died at the age of 32. During his short life, Ramanujan proved over
    3000 theorems and equations, on a wide range of topics. His work created

    __André Weil__ (1906 – 1998) was one of the most influential French
    mathematicians in the 20th century.

    He was one of the founders of the _Bourbaki group_, a group of
    mathematicians working under the collective pseudonym _Nicolas Bourbaki_.
    The goal of the Bourbaki group was to unify all of mathematics with a
    formal, axiomatic foundation.

    Weil believed that many problems in algebra and number theory had analogous
    versions in algebraic geometry and topology. These are known as _Weil
    conjectures_, and became the basis for both disciplines. They also have
    applications in fields like cryptography and computer science.

    During the second World War, Weil fled to the United States and later joined
    the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton University.

    The British mathematician __Sir Andrew Wiles__ (born 1953) is best known for
    proving Fermat’s Last Theorem, which, until then, was one of the most famous
    unsolved problems in mathematics.

    In 1637, Pierre de Fermat, wrote in the margin of a textbook that he had a
    wonderful proof that the equation `a^n + b^n = c^n` has no integer
    solutions for `n > 2`. Unfortunately, no one was able to find a proof –
    until Wiles, some 400 years later.

    Wiles had been fascinated by the problem since the age of 10, and spent
    seven years working on it in solitude. He announced his solution in 1993,
    although a small gap in his argument took two more years to fix.

    He was too old to receive the _Fields medal_, the highest award in
    mathematics, which has an age limit of 40. Instead, Wiles was awarded a
    special silver plaque for his work.

    __Ernest Wilkins__ (1923 – 2011) was an American engineer, nuclear scientist
    and mathematician. He attended the University of Chicago at the age of 13,
    becoming its youngest ever student.

    During the second world war, he contributed to the _Manhattan Project_ to
    develop the first nuclear weapons. As a nuclear scientists, he later
    helped to design nuclear reactors to generate power.

    Wilkins published more than 100 papers, covering subjects like differential
    geometry, calculus, nuclear engineering and optics – even though, as an
    African-American, he was often the target of racism.

    for his famous paradoxes, which have fascinated mathematicians for
    centuries.

    One example is the _paradox of motion_: imagine that you want to run a
    100 meter race. You first have to run half the distance (50 meters). But
    before doing that, you have to run a quarter of the distance (25 meters).
    Before running a quarter, you have to run `1/8`th, `1/16`th, and so on.
    This is an infinite number of tasks, which means that you’ll never arrive!

    __Yitang Zhang__ (张益唐, born 1955) was born in China and is now a
    professor of mathematics at the University of California.

    Zhang discovered that there is a number _k_ less than 70 million, so that
    there are infinitely many pairs of prime numbers that are exactly _k_ apart.
    This was a groundbreaking discovery in number theory, for which he
    received the MacArthur award in 2014.

    This is similar to the _Twin Prime conjecture_, which states that there are
    infinitely many pairs exactly 2 apart (for example 11 and 13) – but no one
    knows if this is true.

    __Zu Chongzhi__ (祖沖之, 429 – 500 CE) was a Chinese astronomer, mathematician,
    writer, politician and inventor.

    He calculated Pi accurately to 7 decimal places – a record which was not
    surpassed until 800 years later. To do this, he approximated a circle with
    a 24,576-sided polygon.

    Zu also discovered the formula `4/3 πr^3` for the volume of a sphere. His
    precise astronomical observations allowed him to create a new, more accurate
    calendar and to predict solar eclipses. He also calculated that Jupiter
    takes almost 12 years to orbit the sun.
